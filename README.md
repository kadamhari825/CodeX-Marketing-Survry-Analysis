# CodeX-Marketing-Survry-Analysis
In this project we will dive into marketing survey of CodeX, a German food and beverage company to analyze respondents responses and give recommendations for product development.

## Project Context:
CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India.Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents.

## Task:
As a marketing data analyst my task is to convert these survey results into meningful insights that ultimately helping improve branding,
product development and sales of our energy drink.

## Tools used:
SQL: Query writing  
Power BI : Visualizations   
Power point Presentation: Story telling.

## Insights and recommendations:
1. Target Audience: Our primary target audience should be individuals aged between 15 to 45 years. To effectively reach this demographic, we should utilize online ads and TV commercials, as these channels collectively reach 50% of potential customers.

2. Enhancing Taste: It is crucial to address the low taste rating (3.2) of our energy drink. We can achieve this by incorporating significant changes, such as adding Caffeine, Vitamins, and natural fruit extracts. Given that 49% of our target audience values health consciousness, using natural ingredients will be a game changer.

3. Importance of Packaging: The packaging of our energy drink plays a significant role in consumer preference. Nearly two-thirds of respondents prefer compact and portable cans with innovative bottle designs.

4. Addressing Concerns: The main obstacles that deter potential customers from choosing our drink are its non-availability, health concerns, and unfamiliarity with our brand.

5. Focused Marketing: To counter the lack of awareness about our drink brand, we must concentrate our marketing efforts in key cities like Kolkata, Hyderabad, Chennai, Jaipur, Bangalore, and Pune. More than 55% of survey participants in these cities reported never having heard of our drink.

6. Strengthening Supply Chain: It is essential to bolster our supply chain in Lucknow, Kolkata, Pune, Jaipur, and Delhi, as over 10% of customers have reported encountering unavailability of our drink in stores.

7. Purchasing Preferences: Customers predominantly rely on Supermarkets (45%) and Online stores (25%) for purchasing our drink.

8. Pricing and Packaging Impact: Respondents generally prefer buying drinks priced between Rs 50 to 99, and limited-edition packaging appears to have no significant impact on buying behavior.

9. Expanding Marketing Efforts: To widen our market reach, we should consider sponsoring and organizing quality events, similar to Red Bull's successful strategy with events like Formula 1, Mountain biking, and snowboarding.

10. Brand Ambassador: Apart from improving taste and packaging, appointing a brand ambassador like Ranveer Singh, whose values align with our brand's vision, will further enhance our brand image.
